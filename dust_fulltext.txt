Using spectroscopically selected galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey we present a detection of reddening effects from the circumgalactic medium of galaxies which we attribute to an extended distribution of dust. We detect the mean change in the colors of “standard crayons” correlated with the presence of foreground galaxies at z̃ 0.05 as a function of angular separation. Following Peek & Graves, we create standard crayons using passively evolving galaxies corrected for Milky Way reddening and color-redshift trends, leading to a sample with as little as 2% scatter in color. We devise methods to ameliorate possible systematic effects related to the estimation of colors, and we find an excess reddening induced by foreground galaxies at a level ranging from 10 to 0.5 mmag on scales ranging from 30 kpc to 1 Mpc. We attribute this effect to a large-scale distribution of dust around galaxies similar to the findings of Ménard et al. We find that circumgalactic reddening is a weak function of stellar mass over the range 6× {10}9 {M}☉ -6× {10}10 {M}☉ and note that this behavior appears to be consistent with recent results on the distribution of metals in the gas phase. We also find that circumgalactic reddening has no detectable dependence on the specific star formation rate of the host galaxy.
